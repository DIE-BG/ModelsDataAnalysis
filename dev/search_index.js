We can see that most series require a block length of less than 10. However, time series like core inflation (D4L_CPIXFE) and the year-on-year change of the exchange rate (D4L_S) require a higher block length, as they are more persistent, and thus, their correlogram functions decay slower. The figure also shows the average and the median block length.  The Julia library computes the median by default to combine the different block lengths for a dataset. Unfortunately, we could not found any formal criteria to choose the block length for a multivariate dataset.

We used a unified metric to compare the performance of the two methods in replicating the sample mean, variance, autocorrelation function, and correlation matrix between covariates. We found that the stationary block bootstrap method outperforms the moving block bootstrap method in all statistics of interest. We also compared our results with the optimal block length methodology proposed by Patton, Politis, and White (2009) and found that the optimal block length is consistent with the results obtained from our simulation study. Moreover, the methodology presented here can be used to determine the optimal block length for the block bootstrap method in a dataset of interest. We leave for future work the extension of this methodology to other resampling methods, such as frequency domain bootstrap methods.
